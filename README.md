# urban_precipitation_downscaling
This repository consists of all the codes and data required to perform urban precipitation downscaling. 

High resolution (300m X 300m) urban precipitation data can be generated by using evaluation notebook in the src directory. The trained weight file can be found at data/trained_weights.h5 to generate the high resolution data product. These weights can be used to generate high resolution urban precipitation products for any city.
